# Comprehensive-Time-Series-and-Regression-Analysis-of-Monthly-Airline-Passenger-Traffic-Using-R
Performs comprehensive regression and time series analysis on the Airline Passengers Dataset using R, including trend modeling, seasonal decomposition, ACF/PACF analysis, and ARIMA forecasting to predict passenger demand.

## 📌 Overview

This project performs an in-depth statistical and time series analysis of the Airline Passengers Dataset using R. The objective is to analyze trend, seasonality, and growth patterns, and to build forecasting models for predicting future passenger traffic.

The project integrates classical statistical methods with modern time series techniques.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Analyze long-term trend in passenger traffic
2. Identify seasonal patterns
3. Perform hypothesis testing
4. Build regression models (linear, multiple, polynomial, non-linear)
5. Conduct time series analysis using ACF & PACF
6. Forecast future values using ARIMA
